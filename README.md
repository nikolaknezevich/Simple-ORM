## Synopsis

Simple ORM which I aim to implement as Codeigniter ORM module but also to used separatly in PHP apps. 
Code is in early development stage and for example purposes. 

## Example
Copy code to local server. Make Doctrine like schema in directory named "entity". 
Eg. entity/product.orm.yml. 
Open console in home dir and type: php console app:create-class to transform yml schemas to php objects. Use created objects placed in model directory in your PHP application.
