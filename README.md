Simple ORM which I aim to implement as Codeigniter ORM module but also to used separatly in PHP apps. 
Code is in early development stage and for example purposes. Copy code to local server. Make doctrine like schema in dir entity. 
Eg. entity/product.orm.yml. 
Open console in home dir and type: php console app:create-class to transform yml schemas to php objects.
